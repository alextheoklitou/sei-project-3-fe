# Project 3 - Sniff
## Overview
This project was the third and first full-stack project of the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive Course. This was a group project, done in a group of 3 and lasted one week. As a group, we chose to create a dating website for animals called 'Sniff'

## Brief
The brief was to create a full-stack application by creating our own back-end and front-end

* Mongoose
* MongoDB
* Insomnia
* React.js
* JSX

## Planning
Our first stage of planning was deciding what app we wanted to create as we were given free reign for this. We quickly realised we had a mutual love for pets and animals and we also wanted to push ourselves and create something new which we hadn't done before, such as a dating app so we just combined the two.

We were able to work well together and bounce ideas to come up with an initial plan and put everything in an Excalidraw:

We decided that we wanted to all work on as many components as we could, especially aspects that were new to us all therefore we all acted as full-stack engineers for this project.

As a team, we split up the back-end components in order to work through them as quickly as possible and once that was up and running we focused on the front-end.

## The Build
Throughout the projects we had daily stand-ups to check in on what everyone was working on and help eachother with any bugs or issues. We also stayed on a Zoom call all day while working in order to keep open communication and support eachother as well as using Slack to share code snippets.

We used branches to code individually and throughout the day would have multiple 'mergefests' where we would take turns merging to the main branch and pushing so that we would all have the most up-to-date code.
